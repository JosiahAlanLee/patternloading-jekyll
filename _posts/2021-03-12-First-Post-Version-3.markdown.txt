The last time I had something resembling a blog it was at <a href="https://patternloading.wordpress.com">a Wordpress Site</a>, and it was mostly just a collection of Soundcloud links. 

As those links were all broken I've cleaned out the old posts and added my current collection of mixtapes if your're feeling interested.
