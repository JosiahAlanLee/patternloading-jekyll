The last time I had something resembling a blog it was at <a href="https://patternloading.wordpress.com">a Wordpress Site</a>, and it was mostly just a collection of Soundcloud links in 2014. As those links were all broken I've cleaned out the old posts and added my current collection of mixtapes if you're feeling interested... 

I run a small music label on Bandcamp, which you can find <a href="https://patternloading.bandcamp.com/">here.</a> 

Prior to even the 2014 iteration I ran a Wordpress site which I have saved but has been scoured from the face of the internet.

This site "Pattern Loader" was essentially done in 2009. 

And prior to even that I ran a couple of Blogspot sites under the alias "scarboi" starting in 2003. 

It's been a solid 19 years of yelling at the Internet and I'm not sure why this version will be any different.
