The last time I had something resembling a blog it was at <a href="https://patternloading.wordpress.com">a Wordpress Site</a>, and it was mostly just a collection of Soundcloud links in 2014. As those links were all broken I've cleaned out the old posts and added my current collection of mixtapes if you're feeling interested... 

In 2019 I ran a small music label on Bandcamp, which you can find <a href="https://patternloading.bandcamp.com/">here.</a> 

I didn't really get much of anywhere with it but I'm proud of the two albums and two singles I helped put out, one of them even made a little money for the artist. Prior to even the 2014 iteration I ran a Wordpress site which I have saved but has been scoured from the face of the internet.

This site "Pattern Loader" was essentially done in 2009. 

And prior to even that I ran a couple of Blogspot sites under the alias "scarboi" starting in 2003. 

It's been a solid 18 years of yelling at the Internet and I'm not sure why this version will be any different.
