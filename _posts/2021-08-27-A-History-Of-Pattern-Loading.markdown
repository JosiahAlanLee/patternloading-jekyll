The last time I had something resembling a blog it was at <a href="https://patternloading.wordpress.com">a Wordpress Site</a>, and it was mostly just a collection of Soundcloud links in 2014. As those links were all broken I've cleaned out the old posts and added my current collection of mixtapes if you're feeling interested... 

Prior to even the 2014 iteration I ran a Wordpress site which I have saved but has been scoured from the face of the internet. This site "Pattern Loader" was essentially done in 2009. 

And prior to even that I ran a couple of Blogspot sites under the alias "scarboi" starting in 2003.

As of the moment I run a small music label on Bandcamp, which you can find <a href="https://patternloading.bandcamp.com/">here.</a> 

Additionally I have recently started uploading NFTs to <a href="https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/Echevarian/creations">Hic Et Nunc</a> and am fairly excited about the idea of low carbon debt version using Tezos. 

I have created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8UmoW3aXp7NzpMn-jDydag">Youtube channel</a> in which I have been posting experiments with video feedback and perhaps eventually VJ sets and music videos.
